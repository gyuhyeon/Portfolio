# Portfolio website
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gyuhyeon/Portfolio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gyuhyeon/Portfolio) [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/c451487dd20f4c2d4313/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/gyuhyeon/Portfolio/maintainability)  
This is a repository for my portfolio website.  
I'm thinking about making a tutorial that covers everything from basic static html to setting up aws, node.js, mysql, along with nginx to server as a front proxy.  
But for now, this is a consolidated project just to showcase my past works.

# How to use
If, for some reason you want to run this locally, you'll have to set up correct mysql(for past project showcases)/twilio(also for past project functionalities)/captcha configs in the format specified in the source code.  
You'll also have to make sure you have nodejs ^6.12.0.  
```
sudo npm install
node app.js
```
